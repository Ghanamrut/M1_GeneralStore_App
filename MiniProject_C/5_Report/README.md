# Description
Mini Project in C Programming Language aimed at making a student data record management application that can be used to calculate,display and compare student marks record

# SWOT Analysis

# Strengths:-
•	Volume Administration: - Helps to manage a greater number of students easily.

•	Data Accessibility: - Helps to track roll numbers, names, percentage,etc.

•	Time saving: - Browsing through papers takes time and is significantly reduced by the help of this program owing to response time of system which is very less. 

•	Security: - Hardcopy Data gets lost easily and maintaining data in a rush is hectic as well as leads to mismanagement thus diminishing human error and keeps records           explicit.

# Weakness:-
•	Valid/Invalid Inputs: - User needs to know the valid inputs for particular actions.

•	Time taken: - The time taken to type in the valid inputs might vary with user.

•	Employment: - Digitalisation often leads to decrease in work opportunities

# Opportunities:-
•	Automation: - Voice controlled assistant are an upcoming technological marvel and can be used here as well.

•	Growth: - Small use software are increasing as technology is reaching at every small level almost every local schools are starting to use such programs.

•	Reduces malpractice like editing student info.

# Threats:-
•	Customer Belief: - Some local schools are adamant to sticking to conventional methods.

•	Size: - Bigger the school size and student database, storage need increases and is therefore a bit of a concern.


# 5 Ws And 1H
1.	Why: - The goal of this project is to make it easier for schools to manage the database in an efficient manner.


2.	What: - We need to make a C program that uses various functions that will be used various times throughout the program to display and use student details such as roll                 no, total students, names,marks, etc.


3.	Who: - This Project is aimed for various schools or educational institutions and with certain changes can be made available to store employee details as well.


4.	When: - It will be completed in 2 week time.


5.	Where: - The Program will be made on Visual Studio Code and Ubuntu linux OS, Windows 10 OS and various other Microsoft Office tools will be used.


6.	How: - The project will be completed with step by step accounting of requirements and specifications and analysis of various C language functions, data types,                        variables, parameters and other tools that can be used and sequential arrangement and procedural setup to move along the project will be decided to ensure                      smooth flow in the project process.

# Requirements of the Project:-

# 1) High Level Requirements:-

•	Storing the following things of a Student:-
a.	First and Last name 
b.	Roll No
c.	Marks of student in four subjects.

•	To Search student details by:-
a.	First Name
b.	Roll No

•	Comparing Student Marks

•	Total scores in each subject

•	Percentage Calculation

# 2) Low Level Requirements:-
•	Creating a Menu:-
A menu function is created to provide options for the user to select different functions.

•	Multiple Student details so as to create a student record base.

•	Should easily browse through the different student details to provide marks of a particular student on choosing first name and in some cases roll no.

•	Display error messages.
